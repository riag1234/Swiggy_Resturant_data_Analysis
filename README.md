# 🥡 Swiggy Sales Data – Excel Analysis Dashboard

An interactive **Excel-based business intelligence dashboard** built to analyze Swiggy food-delivery sales, understand city/state revenue contribution, customer rating behavior, category trends (Veg vs Non-Veg), and uncover time-based demand patterns.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Food delivery platforms like **Swiggy** accumulate large volumes of order and customer data. Without visualization, decision-makers cannot identify **high-performing regions, customer trends, or business gaps**.

This project converts raw data into **actionable insights** using Excel — enabling business teams to **track sales, ratings, average order values, and peak demand periods** for strategic decision-making.

---

## 🧾 Problem Statement
Business leadership needs a **single-source dashboard** that answers:

- Which states & cities generate the highest sales?
- What is the month-wise & quarter-wise revenue trend?
- Do weekends generate more demand than weekdays?
- What is the sales share between Veg vs Non-Veg dishes?
- What are the Avg. Ratings and how many reviews contributed?

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Aggregate & clean Swiggy order dataset  
✔ Build Excel pivot-based dashboard with KPIs  
✔ Enable monthly & regional comparison using slicers  
✔ Deliver visual insights to guide business decisions
